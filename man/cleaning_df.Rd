\description{
This function "cleans" up a dataframe so that it can be used by the application
}
\details{
For the application to work well, the input dataframe data should
contain only numeric variables with no missing values.
This function acts as a safeguard in case the user does not clean up his dataframe.
Qualitative variables are removed and only non-missing values are kept
in the final dataframe.
